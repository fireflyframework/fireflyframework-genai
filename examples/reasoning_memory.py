"""Reasoning with Memory integration example.

Demonstrates:
- Running a reasoning pattern with a ``MemoryManager``.
- Working memory enrichment across reasoning steps.
- ``FireflyAgent.run_with_reasoning()`` with ``conversation_id``.
- Inspecting working memory facts after execution.

Usage::

    uv run python examples/reasoning_memory.py
