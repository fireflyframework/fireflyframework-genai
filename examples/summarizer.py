ARTICLE = """\
Artificial intelligence has undergone a dramatic transformation over the past
decade. Early systems relied on hand-crafted rules and expert knowledge, but
the advent of deep learning shifted the paradigm toward data-driven approaches.
Transformer architectures, introduced in 2017, became the foundation of modern
language models. These models learn statistical patterns from vast text corpora
and can generate remarkably fluent prose, translate languages, summarise
documents, and answer complex questions. However, challenges remain: models can
hallucinate facts, struggle with multi-step reasoning, and reflect biases
present in training data. Researchers are now exploring techniques like
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), chain-of-thought prompting,
and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to mitigate these limitations and push
AI toward more reliable, grounded, and transparent behaviour.
