"""Plugin discovery system for the Firefly GenAI framework.

Third-party packages can register agents, tools, and reasoning patterns by
declaring entry points in their ``pyproject.toml``::

    [project.entry-points."fireflyframework_genai.agents"]
    my_agent = "my_package.agents:MyAgent"

    [project.entry-points."fireflyframework_genai.tools"]
    my_tool = "my_package.tools:MyTool"

    [project.entry-points."fireflyframework_genai.reasoning_patterns"]
    my_pattern = "my_package.reasoning:MyPattern"

On startup, :meth:`PluginDiscovery.discover_all` scans these groups and loads
the referenced objects so they can self-register with their respective
registries.
