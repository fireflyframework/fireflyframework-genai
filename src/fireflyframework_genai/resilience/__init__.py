"""Resilience patterns for fault tolerance and failure recovery.

This module provides resilience patterns to make applications more robust
against transient failures, cascading errors, and service degradation.

Available Patterns:
    - Circuit Breaker: Prevents cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services
    - Retry with Backoff: Automatically retries failed requests with exponential backoff
    - Bulkhead: Isolates failures to prevent resource exhaustion

Example::

    from fireflyframework_genai.resilience.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreaker

    breaker = CircuitBreaker(
        failure_threshold=5,
        recovery_timeout=60.0,
    )

    async def make_api_call():
        async with breaker:
            return await api.call()
"""

__all__ = ["CircuitBreaker", "CircuitBreakerMiddleware"]
